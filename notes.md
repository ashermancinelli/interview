I have been at the lab for 3 years or so, and I have a 
background in deep learning and HPC development helping 
domain scientists rewrite their code to be more performant.
My role in this project is to manage the build system,
integration of new libraries, and regression testing.

I have been at the lab for about 3 years, and I have a background in high
performance computing and I oversee software development tasks for ExaSGD, a
member of the exascale computing project.

With HiOp, we've 'rolled our own' test suite to be lightweight and extensible.
It was built to take advantage of modern C++ and 

- What is CMake?

- Why might we want to use CMake?

a. Example:
    - if library A is only used internally
    - if library B is used internally and externally
    - if library C is found and only used by our users

    - constexpr
    - variadic templates parameters
    - lambda functions
    - optional

Questions from Lori:

- What was your facorite project? What was your contribution? Are there any 
    unique challenges? How did you solve them?

- Talk about a time when you had to complete a work assignment with little or
    no guidance and what was the outcome?

- Describe the most significant written document, report, or presentation you
    have completed.

- Describe a time when you had to quickly learn a new skill to handle a
    changing work environment

- Tell us how you work with others to create or foster diversity and inclusion
    in the workplace.

- What is one area of interest you have and how did you go about learning about
    it?
