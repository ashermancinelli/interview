I have been at the lab for 3 years or so, and I have a 
    background in deep learning and HPC development helping 
    domain scientists rewrite their code to be more performant.
    My role in this project is to manage the build system,
    integration of new libraries, and regression testing.

- What is CMake?

- Why might we want to use CMake?

a. Example:
    if library A is only used internally
    if library B is used internally and externally
    if library C is found and only used by our users

- What are some more modern features of C++ 11/14/17?
    - constexpr
    - variadic templates parameters
    - lambda functions
    - optional

- What is a good use case for a constant expression?

- What is MPI?
    a. How might we use MPI to, say, multiply two vectors?

- What is CUDA?
    a. How might we use CUDA to, say, multiply two vectors?
    b. When would you use shared memory in cuda?
    c. Advantage of global/texture/shared memory?

- When would we want to use each of the following granularities of parallelism?

- What is a data race or race condition? Have you ever had to resolve an issue of this sort?

- Could you explain the acronym SIMD?

- what development environment are you the most familiar with?

- what did you learn in the parallel computing class?

- what part of parallel computing is the most exciting for you?

- what excites you more, the developement of the theory/algorithm or the application/implementation?

- Have you had to work in a large team all working on the same project?

- could you describe a time you had to learn a new skill quickly?

- Are you familiar with a "hardware in the loop" simulation?

- what would make this position a success for you?
    - publication
    - networking
    - lines of code
    - skill development
    - career
    - narrowing down field
